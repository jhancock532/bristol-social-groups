# Bristol Social

A website listing social groups in Bristol, UK. [Check out the live site](https://bristolsocialgroups.com/), and read about the project ethos on [the about page](https://bristolsocialgroups.com/about).

The design system for this project is built with Storybook and hosted with GitHub Pages. [View the project components & style guide here](https://jhancock532.github.io/bristol-social-groups/?path=/docs/introduction--docs).

## Data storage

Information regarding groups is found in the `data/groups` folder. Each group resides within a separate folder that contains a `details.json` file.

## AI

The repo has a few automation tools for developers - see the `.cursor/rules` prompt files. [Data migrations](https://github.com/jhancock532/bristol-social-groups/blob/main/documentation/migrations.md) require an Anthropic API key set in `.env` and cost 15 - 20 cents to run.
